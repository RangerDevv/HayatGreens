        Hayat Greens began as a dream shared by two lifelong friends, Amin and Tej, who grew up in different corners of India. Amin hailed from the vibrant streets of Delhi, where North Indian dishes like creamy Butter Paneer and spicy Chole Bhature ruled every family gathering. Tej, on the other hand, grew up in Chennai, surrounded by the comforting aromas of dosa batter fermenting and the tangy spices of her grandmother’s sambars.

Despite their different culinary backgrounds, both Amin and Tej shared one common belief: food brings people together. When they met in college, their bond grew stronger over a love for cooking and a deep respect for plant-based eating, inspired by India’s long-standing traditions of vegetarianism.

After years of working in separate fields, they decided to unite their passions and celebrate the diverse flavors of Indian cuisine—both North and South—while staying true to their shared vegan values. That’s how Savor India was born. <br><br>

<strong>Our Philosophy</strong>
At Savor India, we don’t just serve food—we tell stories. Every dish on our menu carries the essence of Indian kitchens, where spices, love, and culture blend harmoniously. Our recipes are inspired by Amin’s grandmother’s rich curries and Tej’s father’s hand-ground chutneys, reimagined with a vegan twist to honor tradition while embracing innovation.

By bringing the best of North and South India to one table, Savor India celebrates unity in diversity—one delicious bite at a time.

Today, our mission is simple: to create a warm, welcoming space where everyone can enjoy India’s vibrant flavors, whether you’re a lifelong vegan, a curious foodie, or simply someone who loves great food.
